## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PierrunoYT/rubiks-cube-3d.git
   cd rubiks-cube-3d
   ```

2. **Start a local web server** (required for ES6 modules):
   
   **Python** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open: `http://localhost:8000/rubikscube.html`
   
   **Node.js**:

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Three.js r128**: 3D rendering engine
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system for better code organization
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules:
  - **state.js**: Centralized state management
  - **scene.js**: Three.js scene initialization and lighting
  - **cube.js**: Rubik's cube construction (27 individual cubelets)
  - **labels.js**: Face label creation and management
  - **indicators.js**: Visual rotation indicators and highlighting
  - **rotation.js**: Layer rotation animation logic
  - **actions.js**: Cube actions (scramble, solve, reset)
  - **controls.js**: Keyboard and mouse input handling
  - **colorPicker.js**: Color picker functionality
  - **solution.js**: Solution finding and execution system
  - **modal.js**: Themed result modal (replaces native `alert()` for solve results)
  - **ui.js**: UI updates and event listener management
  - **main.js**: Application orchestration and initialization

### Key Technologies
- **Quaternion Rotations**: Smooth, gimbal-lock-free rotations
- **Raycasting**: Precise click detection for:
  - Color picker face selection
  - Shift+Drag layer detection
- **Canvas 2D Context**: Dynamic texture generation for:
  - Face labels (sprites)
  - Rotation count badges
- **Phong Materials**: Realistic lighting with:
  - Ambient lighting for overall illumination
  - Directional lights for shadows and depth
  - Key lights for proper contrast
  - Colored rim lights for style
  - Emissive materials for layer highlighting

### Cube Construction
- **27 Cubelets**: Each cubelet is an independent group
- **Black Plastic Body**: Single 0.9 unit mesh per cubelet with gaps for realism
- **Colored Stickers**: Separate geometry with borders and beveling
- **Efficient Filtering**: Layer selection uses position-based filtering
- **State Tracking**: Complete move history for undo/solve functionality

### Animation System
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Linear interpolation for position, spherical for rotation
- **60 FPS Target**: RequestAnimationFrame-based render loop
- **Pulsing Effects**: Sine wave animations for indicators and highlights
- **Ease Functions**: Cubic ease-out for reset animation
- **Opacity Fading**: Dynamic ground/grid visibility based on camera position

### Solution Algorithm
- **Kociemba Two-Phase Solver**: Real solver (via [cubejs](https://github.com/ldez/cubejs)) that reads the live 3D cube state and solves any valid configuration in ≤22 moves — see [SOLVERS.md](SOLVERS.md)
- **State Reading**: Converts sticker world positions into a standard 54-facelet string
- **Notation Translation**: Standard cube notation (R, L', U2, etc.) — clockwise as viewed from outside each face
- **Smart Grouping**: Consecutive identical moves are grouped for clarity
- **Preview Mode**: Non-destructive move preview with automatic reversal
- **Validation**: Detects manual state changes and invalidates solution; detects unsolvable color-picker states

### Module Organization

The codebase is organized by feature and responsibility:

- **State Management**: All shared state is centralized in `state.js`, making it easy to track and manage application state
- **Scene Setup**: `scene.js` handles all Three.js initialization, including camera, renderer, ground plane, and lighting
- **Cube Logic**: `cube.js` contains the cubelet construction logic with proper color assignment
- **Visual Feedback**: `indicators.js` and `labels.js` handle all visual guidance elements
- **Core Mechanics**: `rotation.js` manages the animated layer rotations with quaternion-based transforms
- **User Actions**: `actions.js` implements high-level cube operations (scramble, solve, reset)
- **Input Handling**: `controls.js` manages all keyboard and mouse interactions
- **Solution System**: `solution.js` contains the complete solution finding and execution logic
- **UI Layer**: `ui.js` handles DOM updates and keeps UI logic separate from core functionality
- **Orchestration**: `main.js` ties everything together and initializes the application

### Benefits of Modular Structure

- **Maintainability**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Testability**: Modules can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Functions can be easily reused across different parts of the application
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
- **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and navigate

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Center Focus**: Cube positioned at center with camera orbiting around
- **Corner Panels**: Controls (top-left), actions (top-right), info (bottom)
- **On-Demand Panels**: Solution panel and color picker appear when needed
- **Subtle Depth**: Layered UI with shadows and backdrop blur

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Cyan (#4ecdc4) for interactive elements and highlights
- **Background**: Dark blue gradient (#1a1a2e to #0f0f1e)
- **Accent**: Golden yellow (#ffd700) for preview mode
- **Semantic**: Red for warnings, green for success

### Interaction Design
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed when needed
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, pulsing animations, state colors
- **Forgiving Interface**: Preview mode lets users explore without commitment
- **Clear Affordances**: Buttons, badges, and indicators communicate function

## 🧪 Browser Compatibility

**Requirements**: Modern browser with ES6 module support

- ✅ Chrome/Edge 61+ (Recommended)
- ✅ Firefox 60+
- ✅ Safari 11+
- ✅ Opera 48+
- ⚠️ IE11 (Not supported - ES6 modules not available)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Color picker edits that create an *unsolvable* cube (e.g. a single twisted corner) are detected and reported — use Reset
- Preview mode may have slight timing variations on slower devices
- Shift+Drag rotation direction depends on camera angle (working as intended)
- Solver requires an internet connection on first load (Three.js and cubejs are loaded from CDNs)

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Learning to Solve**: Use Preview mode to see moves before committing
2. **Custom Patterns**: Use color picker to create interesting designs
3. **Smooth View**: Drag slowly for precise camera control
4. **Quick Rotations**: Shift+Drag is fastest for single moves
5. **Notation Practice**: Watch the solution steps to learn standard notation
6. **Reset Often**: Use Reset button to practice algorithms from solved state
