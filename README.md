## ‚ú® Features

- **Realistic Design**: Black plastic body with colored stickers, just like a real Rubik's cube
- **Smooth Animations**: 300ms smooth rotation animations with proper quaternion-based transforms
- **Standard Color Scheme**: Red, Orange, White, Yellow, Green, Blue
- **Full Controls**: Rotate any face clockwise or counter-clockwise
- **Scramble Function**: Randomize the cube with 20 moves
- **Interactive Camera**: Drag with mouse or use arrow keys to rotate the view
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, polished interface with glowing accents

## üéÆ Controls

### Face Rotations
- **R** / **Shift+R** - Right face (clockwise/counter-clockwise)
- **L** / **Shift+L** - Left face
- **U** / **Shift+U** - Up/Top face
- **D** / **Shift+D** - Down/Bottom face
- **F** / **Shift+F** - Front face
- **B** / **Shift+B** - Back face

### View Controls
- **Mouse Drag** - Rotate camera view
- **Arrow Keys** - Rotate camera view
- **S** - Scramble cube

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rubiks-cube.git
   ```

2. Open `rubikscube.html` in your browser - that's it!

No build process, no dependencies to install. Just open and play!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Three.js r128**: For 3D rendering
- **Pure JavaScript**: No frameworks or build tools needed
- **Quaternion Rotations**: Smooth, gimbal-lock-free rotations
- **Realistic Materials**: Phong materials with proper lighting and shadows
- **Modular Design**: Each cubelet is constructed with a black body and colored stickers

## üé® Design

The cube features:
- Black plastic cubelets with visible gaps (0.88 unit size in 1.0 unit grid)
- Colored stickers with subtle borders and beveling
- Multiple light sources for realistic depth and shadows
- Rim lighting for a professional look
