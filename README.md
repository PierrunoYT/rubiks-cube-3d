## ‚ú® Features

- **Realistic Design**: Black plastic body with colored stickers, just like a real Rubik's cube
- **Smooth Animations**: 300ms smooth rotation animations with proper quaternion-based transforms
- **Standard Color Scheme**: Red, Orange, White, Yellow, Green, Blue
- **Full Controls**: Rotate any face clockwise or counter-clockwise
- **Color Picker Tool**: Select colors and click on cube faces to customize them
- **Solution Finder**: Get step-by-step instructions to solve the cube
  - Shows each move in standard notation (R, L', U, etc.)
  - Execute moves one at a time or auto-solve
  - Works with scrambled and manually manipulated cubes
- **Move Tracking**: Displays move counter and enables solve functionality
- **Scramble Function**: Randomize the cube with 20 moves
- **Solve Function**: Automatically reverse all moves to return to the solved state
- **Reset Function**: Smoothly restore cube to its initial state
- **Interactive Camera**: Drag with mouse or use arrow keys to rotate the view
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, polished interface with glowing accents

## üéÆ Controls

### Face Rotations
- **R** / **Shift+R** - Right face (clockwise/counter-clockwise)
- **L** / **Shift+L** - Left face
- **U** / **Shift+U** - Up/Top face
- **D** / **Shift+D** - Down/Bottom face
- **F** / **Shift+F** - Front face
- **B** / **Shift+B** - Back face

### View Controls
- **Mouse Drag** - Rotate camera view
- **Arrow Keys** - Rotate camera view
- **S** - Scramble cube

### Color Picker
- **Click Color** - Select a color from the picker (bottom left)
- **Click Face** - Click on any cube sticker to change its color
- All 6 standard Rubik's cube colors available (Red, Orange, White, Yellow, Green, Blue)

### Solution Finder
- **Get Solution Button** - Click to analyze the cube and get solving steps
- **Next Step** - Execute one move at a time with visual guidance
- **Auto Solve** - Automatically execute all remaining steps
- Shows moves in standard Rubik's cube notation (R, L', U2, etc.)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PierrunoYT/rubiks-cube-3d.git
   ```

2. Open `rubikscube.html` in your browser - that's it!

## üåê Live Demo

**[Try it live on GitHub Pages!](https://pierrunoyt.github.io/rubiks-cube-3d/rubikscube.html)**

No build process, no dependencies to install. Just open and play!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Three.js r128**: For 3D rendering
- **Pure JavaScript**: No frameworks or build tools needed
- **Quaternion Rotations**: Smooth, gimbal-lock-free rotations
- **Realistic Materials**: Phong materials with proper lighting and shadows
- **Modular Design**: Each cubelet is constructed with a black body and colored stickers
- **Raycasting**: Click detection for interactive color changing
- **Move History**: Tracks all rotations for undo/solve functionality

## üé® Design

The cube features:
- Black plastic cubelets with visible gaps (0.88 unit size in 1.0 unit grid)
- Colored stickers with subtle borders and beveling
- Multiple light sources for realistic depth and shadows
- Rim lighting for a professional look
- Interactive color picker with hover effects and selection indicators
- Modern glassmorphism UI panels with backdrop blur effects
