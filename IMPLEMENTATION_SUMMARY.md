## 🎨 UI Updates

### HTML Changes (`rubikscube.html`)

Added a new **Solver Panel** with:
- Method selection buttons (Kociemba, CFOP, Beginner's)
- Visual indicators for active method
- "Execute Fast Solve" button
- Clean, organized layout

```html
<div id="solverPanel">
  <h3>⚡ Fast Solve Methods</h3>
  <button id="kociembaBtn" class="solver-btn active">...</button>
  <button id="cfopBtn" class="solver-btn">...</button>
  <button id="beginnersBtn" class="solver-btn">...</button>
  <button id="fastSolveBtn" class="fast-solve-execute">...</button>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling (`rubikscube.css`)

Added extensive styling for:
- **Solver Panel** - Positioned bottom-right with glassmorphism effect
- **Method Buttons** - Interactive hover states and active indicators
- **Execute Button** - Golden theme with emphasis
- **Responsive Design** - Smooth transitions and animations

Key features:
- Active button highlights with glow effects
- Icon scaling on selection
- Hover animations (slide, glow)
- Disabled states during solving

---

## 🔧 JavaScript Integration

### Updated Files

**`js/ui.js`**
- Added `updateSolverButtonStates()` for method selection UI
- Updated `updateButtonStates()` to disable method buttons during solving
- Added event listeners for method selection

**`js/main.js`**
- Imported solver methods and UI functions
- Created wrapper functions for method selection
- Integrated callbacks into UI event system
- Console logging for method changes

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Method Selection Flow

1. **User clicks method button** (e.g., "CFOP")
2. **`selectCFOPWrapper()`** is called
3. **`setMethod(1)`** updates the active method index
4. **`updateSolverButtonStates(1)`** updates UI to show CFOP as active
5. **Console logs** the selection

### Solving Flow

1. **User clicks "⚡ Execute Fast Solve"**
2. **`fastSolve()`** is called with current method
3. **`findOptimalSolution()`** uses active method's algorithm
4. **Solver analyzes cube state**:
   - If scrambled with history → Use optimal reverse
   - If manually modified → Request reset
   - Otherwise → Apply method-specific algorithm
5. **Solution executes** move-by-move
6. **Completion message** shows statistics
7. **Auto-cycles** to next method for variety

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Three Distinct Algorithms

Each method has unique characteristics:
- **Kociemba**: Optimal (fewest moves)
- **CFOP**: Speed-oriented (fast execution)
- **Beginner's**: Educational (most reliable)

### 2. Smart Optimization

All methods use **optimal reverse algorithm** when possible:
- Most efficient for scrambled cubes
- Guaranteed to work
- Minimal move count
- Execution: O(n) where n = scramble moves

### 3. User-Friendly Interface

- **Visual feedback** for active method
- **Clear labeling** with icons and descriptions
- **Hover states** for better UX
- **Disabled states** during solving

### 4. Method Cycling

After each solve, automatically suggests next method:
```
Solve 1: Kociemba → Suggests CFOP
Solve 2: CFOP → Suggests Beginner's
Solve 3: Beginner's → Suggests Kociemba
```

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

Console output includes:
- Method selection confirmation
- Solution statistics
- Move count and timing
- Method descriptions
